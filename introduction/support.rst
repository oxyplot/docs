Community Support
-----------------

OxyPlot has a small community that may help you out if you have questions. If you can't find your answer in the documentation, you can...

- Ask your question on the `forum <http://discussion.oxyplot.org/>`_. This is a good idea if you have multiple questions or a question that might have a more subjective answer (e.g., "recommendations" sorts of things).
- You can also try `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oxyplot>`_. Be sure to use the ``oxyplot`` tag in your question.

Commercial Support
------------------

- We are not aware of anyone offering commercial support
